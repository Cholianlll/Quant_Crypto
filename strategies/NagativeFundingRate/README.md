## What is the daily return or annual return could be?

Given an example with the XEMUSDT (fundingrate: -0.3193%)

| Term                        | Calculation      | Profit    | Note                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Funding rate yield          | 0.3193%*3        | + 0.9579% | Three collection on funding rate for a day                   |
| Transaction fee             | 0.02% * 2 * 3    | -0.12%    | Buy and sell for each collection                             |
| 95% confidence price change | 0.08% * 3        | -0.24%    | The price of certain trading pair will fluctuate between [-0.053, 0.0253], with 5% significant level |
| Daily profit                | -                | 0.5979%   |                                                              |
| Annual return               | (1.005979)^{365} | 8.8096    |                                                              |

Theoretically, it could achieve a very high return.

## About this strategy

Before the funding collection time point, selecting the highest funding rate pair, then opening a long / short position according to the negative / positive funding rate.

After the funding rate collection finished, closing the current position.

## Strategy parameters

```python
KEY = 'your API KEY'
SECRET = 'your API SECRET'
```

Follow the [official instruction](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072) to create a pair of Binance API key and secret.

```python
leverage = 3
```

The maximum amount of [Leverage](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360033162192) available depends on the notional value of your positionâ€”the larger the position, the lower the leverage.

```python
trading_amount = 300 # e.g 100 -> $100
```

`Total size` = `trading_amount` * `entry Price` * `leverage`

```python
funding_rate_bound = 0.0020
```
The minimum absolute funding rate. e.g: `abs(-0.3193%)>0.002`, if there is no pair satisfied the minimum funding rate bound, nothing will be executed during this strategy.

```python
advance_time = 1
lag_time = 15
```
Given an example:

7:59:00 Open a position [MARKET order](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360033779452)

(1 minute)

8:00:00 Funding rate collection

8:01:00 Close the position with a [LIMIT order](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360033779452)

(15 minutes)

8:16:00 If the [LIMIT order](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360033779452) is not executed, then execute a [MARKET order](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360033779452) for stopping loss of holding position.

note: [LIMIT order](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360033779452) will have lower commission fee than [MARKET order](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360033779452)


## Real trading implementation
